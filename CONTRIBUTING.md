## Style Guide

- Python: PEP 8; prefer type hints where reasonable.
- Templates: Keep semantic HTML; use existing Tailwind utility patterns for consistency.
- JavaScript: Keep it small and framework-free unless discussed; prefer fetch and data-attributes.
- Formatting (optional but recommended):
  - Black and Ruff
  
    ```powershell
    pip install black ruff
    ruff check .
    black .
    ```

  - Do not commit changes to db.sqlite3
  - Do not commit environment files (.env) or IDE settings
